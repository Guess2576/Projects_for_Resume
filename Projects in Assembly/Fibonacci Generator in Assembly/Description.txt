This project does the following:
    Prompts the user to enter a number N from 0 to 40.
        If invalid input is detected, an error message prints and exits.
        If valid input, it generates and prints the first N numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

    The fibonacci numbers are iteratively computed using the registers.
